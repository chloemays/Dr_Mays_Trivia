If you are ready to continue with next steps then you may do so, as long as all other completion requirements are met. Implement, integrate, test and ensure completion of tests before continuing, debug and fix, and continue working on tasks from "README.md" until they are all fully implemented, integrated, and everything is working completely. Make sure that you update the roadmap and keep it up to date when changes and progress have been made. Do all of this yourself while adhering to "Fix properly, never disable, never restrict or reduce capabilities of this program, ALWAYS FIX CORRECTLY AND FULLY AND COMPLETELY TO MAKE EVERYTHING WORK FULLY! All integrations, improvements, and adaptations must utilize what already exists and add on to it, never bypassing anything that we have intentionally developed and integrated.". I don't want a summary document. I want the focus to be on development, not writing markdown files that I'll never read.
